### Speed Dating Experiment

Our experimental design is based on meetings through Speed Dating, in which participants engage in 4 min conversations to determine whether or not they are interested in meeting each other again.

If both people "accept", then each is subsequently provided with the other's contact information.

### Who participated in this experiment ?

Our subjects were drawn from students in graduate and professional schools at `Columbia University`. Participants were recruited through a combination of mass e-mail and fliers posted throughout the campus and handed out by research assis- tants. 

In order to sign up for the Speed Dating events, interested students had to register at an online web site on which they reported their names and e-mail addresses and completed a pre-event survey.

### How the data was collected ?

The events were conducted over weekday eve- nings during 2002–2004; data from fourteen of these sessions are utilized in this study.4 In general, two sessions were run in a given evening, with participants randomly distributed between them. Participants were not aware of the number of partners they would be meeting at the Speed Dating event. The number of participants and dates of each session are listed in Table I.5

Upon checking in, each participant was given a clipboard, a pen, and a nametag on which only his or her ID number was written. Each clipboard included a scorecard with a cover over it so that participants’ responses would remain confidential. The scorecard was divided into columns in which participants indicated the ID number of each person they met. Participants would then circle “yes” or “no” under the ID number to indicate whether they would like to see the other person again. Beneath the Yes/No decision was a listing of the six attributes on which the participant was to rate his or her partner: 
`Attractive`, `Sincere`, `Intelligent`, `Fun`, `Ambitious` and `Shared Interests`

After all participants had arrived, two hosts instructed the participants to sit at the two-person tables. The females were told to sit on one side of the tables, while the males were seated across from them. Males were instructed to rotate from table to table, that by the end of the dating event they had rotated to all of the tables, meeting all of the females.7 Each rotation consisted of four minutes during which the participants engaged in conversation. After the four minutes the Speed Dating hosts instructed the participants to take one minute to fill out their scorecards for the person with whom they were just speaking. In some events there were slightly unequal numbers of males and females, so that some subjects in these events experienced empty five-minute intervals.

The morning after the Speed Dating event, participants were sent an e-mail requesting that they complete the follow-up online questionnaire. Ninety-one percent (51 percent female, 49 percent male) of the Speed Dating participants completed this follow-up questionnaire in order to obtain their matches. Upon receipt of their follow-up questionnaire responses, participants were sent an e-mail informing them of their match results.
