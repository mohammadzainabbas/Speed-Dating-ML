### Speed Dating Experiment

Our experimental design is based on meetings through Speed Dating, in which participants engage in 4 min conversations to determine whether or not they are interested in meeting each other again.

If both people "accept", then each is subsequently provided with the other's contact information.

### Who participated in this experiment ?

Our subjects were drawn from students in graduate and professional schools at `Columbia University`. Participants were recruited through a combination of mass e-mail and fliers posted throughout the campus and handed out by research assis- tants. 

In order to sign up for the Speed Dating events, interested students had to register at an online web site on which they reported their names and e-mail addresses and completed a pre-event survey.
